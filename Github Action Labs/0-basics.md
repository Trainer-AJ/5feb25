Here's a simple demo of **GitHub Actions** that covers the basic concepts, including **Jobs, Triggers, and Runners**.  

---

## **GitHub Actions Concepts**
1. **Workflows** â€“ Automated processes defined in a `.yml` file inside `.github/workflows/`.
2. **Triggers (Events)** â€“ Define when the workflow runs (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`).
3. **Jobs** â€“ A workflow consists of one or more **jobs**, each running independently.
4. **Steps** â€“ Jobs contain **steps**, which execute commands or use pre-built **actions**.
5. **Runners** â€“ The machine executing the job (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted).

## **GitHub Actions Demo**
Let's create a simple GitHub Actions workflow.

### **Step 1: Create Workflow File**
Inside your GitHub repository, create:  
ðŸ“‚ `.github/workflows/demo.yml`

```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo

# Trigger: Runs on push to main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

# Define jobs
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # GitHub-hosted runner

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Fetches repository code

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

  deploy:
    name: Deploy Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build # This runs only if "build" succeeds

    steps:
      - name: Deploying...
        run: echo "Deploying application..."
```

## **Understanding the Workflow**
- **Triggers** (`on: push`) â†’ Runs when pushing to `main`.
- **Jobs**:
  - **Build Job** (Runs on `ubuntu-latest`).
  - **Deploy Job** (Runs after `build` finishes using `needs: build`).
- **Steps**:
  - Checkout code, install Node.js, run tests, then deploy.

---

## **How to Test?**
1. Push this file to GitHub (`main` branch).
2. Go to **GitHub â†’ Your Repo â†’ Actions** to see it running.
3. Modify the workflow to trigger on `pull_request`, `schedule`, or `workflow_dispatch` for manual runs.

### Want More?
- Add **matrix builds** (`strategy.matrix`) for multiple environments.
- Use **self-hosted runners** for custom deployments.
- Integrate with **third-party services** (e.g., AWS, Docker).
